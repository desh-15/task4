What I did:
1.Load data, drop irrelevant columns, encode target, split and scale features.
2.Train Logistic Regression model on training data.
3.Evaluate with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.
4.Tune prediction threshold and analyze impact on metrics.
5.Visualize and explain sigmoid function for probability output.
